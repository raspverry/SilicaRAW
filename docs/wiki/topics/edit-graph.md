# Edit Graph

## Summary

The edit graph is the authoritative portable structure for non-destructive edit state. Its shape is defined by JSON Schema, not by ad hoc implementation choices.

## Current Stance

- Use `schemas/edit_graph.schema.json`.
- Use `schemas/edit_graph.example.json` for example shape.
- Implement typed Rust structures equivalent to the schema when the edit task is reached.
- Unknown experimental data belongs under `extensions`.

## Required Sections

- `source`
- `profile`
- `basic`
- `tone`
- `color`
- `detail`
- `lens`
- `geometry`
- `masks`
- `metadata`
- `extensions`

## Notes for LLM Agents

Do not invent an alternate edit graph. When implementation reaches this area, schema validation tests are required.
